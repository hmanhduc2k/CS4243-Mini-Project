# CS4243 Mini-project

## Setting up (on local machine)

- Download the dataset (the folder `cs4243_smallest`) from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pCEBqzQDTJ3PlgdIRBY65jOugJ4xpFi6?usp=sharing)
- Put the folder `cs4243_smallest` in the root directory of the project.
- Run `./initData.sh` to get the `dataset.csv` file with the file paths and their labels.
- (Do this only if you want to re-split the dataset) Run `./splitTrainTest.sh` to get `train_label.csv` and `test_label.csv` files.
